title: "Design discovery through prototyping"
shortDescription: Speculative data labeling application to train an object detection algorithm

tags: [Unstable Label, MFA Thesis]
description: >
 Unstable Label is a project developed as a part of my MFA thesis exploring Machine Learning datasets in a civic context. The end outcome of the project was a set of provocations, ideas and experimental approaches for machine learning presented in the form of a speculative data labeling application
 
 
 This case study gives an overview of the process of developing the concepts at the core of Unstable Label, showing how open-ended prototyping can be a productive tool for early design discovery

#### Process Overview

Typical design processes place prototyping and making in a concept development phase that follows an exploration phase that includes research and synthesis. Prototyping only comes into play once you know what to build, at which point you’ll go through an iterative cycle of designing and building that thing.

### Research & Sensemaking

The first phase of ~~work involved amassing~~ research into the space of machine learning in the civic context through prototyping, getting involved with the local community, and conducting secondary research. 

#### Prototyping

* Data driven policing highlights in an explicit way how power dynamics are embedded within algorithms
* Thinking about algorithms from a much [broader perspective](https://stoplapdspying.medium.com/the-algorithmic-ecology-an-abolitionist-tool-for-organizing-against-algorithms-14fcbd0e64d0), beyond code, into the ways that algorithm is operationalized, how it was developed and more.
* Centering impacts on **community in our analysis** of algorithms, especially the people who aren't always considered users

#### Sensemaking through diagrams

1. Here is the first thing that I want to specify here
2. Here is the second thing that I want to be able to say right here

## What would data collection devices that collected data on fear look like? And how might you intervene in such data collection systems?
