description: >
 Machined Data presents two speculative design scenarios around civic data collection systems for machine learning, illustrating the ways bias can be introduced in the process of data collection and imagining how we might intervene within those systems


 The scenarios, communicated through a set of prototypes I designed and built, serve as a tangible means to engage with the ethical issues surrounding data collection systems in different contexts, and a way to think through approaches to intervene within data collection systems now and in the future.
