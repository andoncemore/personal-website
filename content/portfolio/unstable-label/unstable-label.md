description: >
 *Unstable Label* is a participatory civic data labeling application that facilitates conversations of how we each see and imagine our neighborhoods differently through the collective creation of an object detection algorithm. 


 This is a speculative design project that critiques contemporary data collection practices for Machine Learning, while also imagining alternative approaches. More than a practical proposal for a new data collection system, *Unstable Label* is a set of ideas, provocations, and critiques that are intended to challenge contemporary practices and creatively imagine new paths forward.
