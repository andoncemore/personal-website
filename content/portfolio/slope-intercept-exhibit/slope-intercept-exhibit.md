 I worked with the designer and artist [Sara Hendren](https://sarahendren.com) to design an outdoor, participatory exhibit for her [Slope:Intercept](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/slope-intercept/) project at the [SeMA Biennale Mediacity Seoul 2016](http://mediacityseoul.kr/2016/en/project/sara-hendren). I sketched early design concepts, developed more refined 3D models, worked with a local fabricator to build the exhibit, and supported the installation on site.
