 I worked with the designer and artist [Sara Hendren](https://sarahendren.com) to design an outdoor, participatory exhibit for her [Slope:Intercept](https://sarahendren.com/projects-lab/slope-intercept/) project at the [SeMA Biennale Mediacity Seoul 2016](http://mediacityseoul.kr/2016/en/project/sara-hendren). I sketched early design concepts, developed more refined 3D models, worked with a local fabricator to build the exhibit, and supported the installation on site.

### Initial Sketches

First step was to conduct research on the Slope:Intercept project, and collect reference imagery, and project in this [Pinterest board](https://pin.it/3x8bWtU). Using this research as a starting point, I started sketching concepts.

### Site Specific Ideation

The next step was to develop some concepts, but specific to the site where the work was to be installed.

### Installation Design

Once one of the concepts was finalized on, I developed the engineering drawings to create the parts. We got help with the installation and fabrication from a team in Seoul.
