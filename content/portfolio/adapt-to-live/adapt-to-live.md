 Adapt to Live is a how-to video that shows the basics of cardboard carpentry while advocating for an adaptive mindset towards the built environment. It was developed through the [Adaption+Ability Group](http://aplusa.org/about/) at Olin College for the [Adaptive Design Association](https://www.adaptivedesign.org), an organization that builds custom, low-cost assistive devices.

### Ideation

We started by brainstorming possible projects that could help document the Adaptive Design Association's approach and some of their more classic adaption designs. We mapped out our possible solution space by plotting our ideas on an axis defining how participatory the idea was.

### Story Prototyping

Once we decided on a film, a significant amount of time was spent prototyping different stories, film styles, storyboards, and locations.
