title: Reciept Cardsorting

 Experimenting with physical cardsorting of digital design research material 

---

This prototype started with me thinking about how to improve my qualitative design research synthesis process. 

I wrote a script to print observations from an atomic research repository onto a set of reciepts. Once printed, I could physically sort the cards into affinity groups

In the future, you could  use an AR app to read those groups and bring that information back into the digital repository.
